Gymex - Workouts & Fitness Plans

<b> Problem Statement: </b>

Today's generation needs to concentrate on their health and fitness through a consistent daily exercise routine. Due to the pandemic, it is quite natural that all the gyms closed down which left people sit at home and be lethargic. People did not have access to external gyms which made their fitness graph go down.


<b> Proposed Solution : </b>

Due to these reasons, one of our teams in our campus have come up with an application called "Gymex" which lets the user get an experience of their selected workout tracks. Gymex gives the user options of workout categories. The user can choose from varied categories like Cardio, legs and arms and plan their workout accordingly with set of excercises.The user also gets recomendations as to which excercises they can choose as well as they get to mark their excercise category in favourites.

<b> Functionality & Concepts used : </b>

•	We built this application using Android studio
•	Our application has 3 screens "Home, Workout and Favorite" to navigate through using the Navigation library.
•	In the workout section, the user will be able to navigate through Cardio, legs and arms and will get to choose their desired exercise.
•	After choosing set of exercises; the user can explore each exercise and learn about it by reading its description on how to work out. Also, the user will be given a time-limit for every exercise they wish to perform.
•	We also made use of "Live data, View model and Room database"


<b> Application Link & Future Scope : </b>

We are planning to add a diet plan and calories counter in our application in the future. In addition to this, we are also going to leverage our application, "Gymex" by adding past record of the user as to on which day they exercised or which day they skipped their workout.
